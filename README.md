## LOCAL USE

### Installing
This app was tested with Python 3.11, Python 3.12.3 and Python 3.14. Other versions were not tested.

FOR UNIX : navigate to the project's root folder from your command line
 interface, then run:

``` bash
# Create a virtual environment with the command:
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
source venv/bin/activate

# Install necessary packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run:
``` bash
# Create migrations, i.e. ORM-generated files.
# pay attention that the folder migrations should exists inside each app folder
# its being ignored by git (see .gitignore file)
# can cause issue like: 
# 'CommandError: Unable to serialize database: no such table: voiture_noire_discordprofile'
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create your superuser, i.e. your admin profile.
# Do not put in a real mail address.
python manage.py createsuperuser --username=jean --email=jean@example.com
```

You can now launch the app!

### Launching
``` bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Boom.

The app should be launched from `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`; you can go to 
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` for admin options.

### Good practices
We try to preface commits with "feat", "fix", or "chore" for clarity's sake. Do let me know 
if you have other preferences.

We use [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for Python. If wished, I can include a linting 
library in our packages, such as [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) or 
[Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).

There are tests available, though not all pages or functions are tested because the tests were 
added late and this is done with my spare energy and/or I'm a terrible human being.

## Setting the app in o2switch
### Package

Pick the latest version of Python.

> pip install -r requirements.txt
> pip install mysqlclient.

Indicate core/wsgi.py as the entrance point of your app.

Check that all migrations are applied.

### Change staticfiles (images, CSS, etc)
1. Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
2. Restart the app

### When making changes
1. If on the front end: run `python manage.py collectstatic`, then restart
2. If involving models: run migrations

## Useful commands
To export the db, app by app, into a json format suitable for fixture:
`python manage.py dumpdata voiture_noire --settings=core.settings > voiture_noire/fixtures/voiture_noire.json`

To run the tests specific to one particular TestCase:
`python manage.py test tests.accounts.test_birthdays`
`python manage.py test tests.archives.ArchivesIndexTestCase`

(In prod) To run statics and clear them, in case the files got corrupted (don't forget to restart afterwards!):
`python manage.py collectstatic --clear`
